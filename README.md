6. ### What are the differences between Next.js and React.js

   | Feature            | Next.js                                                                                                         | React.js                                                                                               |
   | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Rendering          | Supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and Client-Side Rendering (CSR).            | Only supports Client-Side Rendering (CSR) by default.                                                  |
   | Routing            | Built-in file-based routing system. Automatically generates routes based on the folder structure.               | No built-in routing. Requires libraries like React Router.                                             |
   | SEO                | Excellent for SEO as it supports SSR and SSG, allowing pre-rendered content to be indexed by search engines.    | Limited SEO capabilities due to client-side rendering. Additional work is needed for SEO optimization. |
   | Performance        | Faster initial page load due to SSR, automatic code splitting, and static generation.                           | May have slower page loads for large apps since everything is rendered on the client.                  |
   | Configuration      | Minimal configuration required. Comes with SSR, SSG, and routing out of the box.                                | Requires manual setup for SSR, routing, and other advanced features.                                   |
   | Learning Curve     | Slightly steeper due to built-in advanced features like SSR, SSG, and API routes.                               | Easier to learn initially, but requires additional tools for SSR and routing.                          |
   | API Routes         | Built-in API routes that can handle backend logic within the same project.                                      | No support for API routes; requires external tools for backend development.                            |
   | Code Splitting     | Automatically splits code into smaller bundles, loading only what's needed for a specific page.                 | Requires manual code splitting or use of lazy loading to optimize performance.                         |
   | Deployment         | Optimized for easy deployment on platforms like Vercel (creators of Next.js) and supports serverless functions. | Deployment typically requires additional configuration for optimized hosting and SSR.                  |
   | Image Optimization | Has a built-in Image component for automatic image resizing and optimization.                                   | Does not provide image optimization; developers need third-party libraries for that.                   |

          <input name="email" type="email" placeholder="Email" required />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

22. ### Are there any performance optimizations available in the Pages Router?

    Yes, you can use features like static generation (SSG), server-side rendering (SSR), and incremental static regeneration (ISR) to optimize performance in the Pages Router.

    - **Static Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time.
    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on each request.
    - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Update static pages after the build.

23. ### How do you handle internationalization in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    By using the `next-i18next` library or the built-in internationalization features in Next.js.

    ```js
    // next.config.js
    module.exports = {
      i18n: {
        locales: ["en", "fr"],
        defaultLocale: "en",
      },
    };
    ```

    Then, you can use the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next` to handle translations in your components.

    ```jsx
    import { useTranslation } from "next-i18next";

    export default function Home() {
      const { t } = useTranslation("common");
      return <h1>{t("welcome")}</h1>;
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

24. ### How do you handle SEO in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    By using the `next/head` component to manage meta tags and other SEO-related elements.

    ```jsx
    import Head from "next/head";

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <>
          <Head>
            <title>My Next.js App</title>
            <meta
              name="description"
              content="A description of my Next.js app"
            />
          </Head>
          <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

25. ### How do you handle static assets in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    By placing static assets in the `public` directory, which is served at the root URL.

    ```
    public/
    ├── images/
    │   └── logo.png
    └── favicon.ico
    ```

    You can access these files using `/images/logo.png` or `/favicon.ico`.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

26. ### How cache works in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    Next.js uses a built-in caching mechanism for static assets and API routes. You can also implement custom caching strategies using HTTP headers or libraries like `next-cache`.

    - **Static Assets**: Cached by default with a long cache lifetime.
    - **API Routes**: Can be cached using HTTP headers like `Cache-Control`.

    ```js
    export default function handler(req, res) {
      res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=3600, immutable");
      res.status(200).json({ message: "Cached response" });
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

27. ### Cache revalidation in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    Cache revalidation can be handled using the `revalidate` option in `getStaticProps` or by setting appropriate HTTP headers in API routes.

    - **Using `revalidate`**: Automatically revalidates static pages after a specified time.

    ```jsx
    export async function getStaticProps() {
      const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const data = await res.json();

      return {
        props: { data },
        revalidate: 10, // Revalidate every 10 seconds
      };
    }
    ```

    - **Using HTTP Headers**: Set cache control headers in API routes.

    ```js
    export default function handler(req, res) {
      res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "s-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate");
      res.status(200).json({ message: "Revalidated response" });
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#pages-router-table-of-contents)

28. ### Optimizing images in Next.js with the Pages Router?

    By using the `next/image` component, which automatically optimizes images for performance.

    ```jsx
    import Image from "next/image";

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>My Next.js App</h1>
          <Image
            src="/images/logo.png"
            alt="Logo"
            width={500}
            height={300}
            quality={75}
          />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    The `next/image` component provides features like lazy loading, responsive images, and automatic format selection.

[:arrow_up: Back to Top](#groups)

1. ### What is the App Router in Next.js?

   The App Router is a new routing system introduced in Next.js 13 that allows for more flexible and powerful routing capabilities, including nested routes, layouts, and server components.

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

2. ### How do you create a route in the App Router?

   In the App Router, you create routes by adding files to the `app` directory. Each file corresponds to a route, and you can create nested routes by creating subdirectories.

   ```
   app/
   ├── page.js          // Home page
   ├── about/
   │   └── page.js      // About page
   └── blog/
       ├── page.js      // Blog index page
       └── [slug]/
           └── page.js  // Dynamic blog post page
   ```

   [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

3. ### How do you create a dynamic route with app router in Next.js?

   In the App Router, you create dynamic routes by using square brackets in the file name. For example, to create a dynamic blog post route, you would create a file named `[slug]/page.js` inside the `blog` directory.

   ```
   app/
   └── blog/
       └── [slug]/
           └── page.js  // Dynamic blog post page
   ```

9. ### How do you handle authentication tokens in Next.js?

   By using cookies or local storage to store authentication tokens.

   ```js
   // Example of setting a token in a cookie
   import Cookies from "js-cookie";

   function setToken(token) {
     Cookies.set("authToken", token, { expires: 7 }); // Expires in 7 days
   }

   function getToken() {
     return Cookies.get("authToken");
   }
   ```

10. ### How to add credentials in nextjs app router?

    To add credentials in Next.js app router, you can use the `next-auth` package with the Credentials provider. First, install it:

    ```bash
    npm install next-auth
    ```

    Then, create a file named `[...nextauth].js` in the `app/api/auth` directory and configure your credentials provider.

    ```js
    import NextAuth from "next-auth";
    import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials";

    export default NextAuth({
      providers: [
        CredentialsProvider({
          name: "Credentials",
          credentials: {
            username: { label: "Username", type: "text" },
            password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
          },
          async authorize(credentials) {
            // Add your own logic to validate credentials here
            const user = { id: 1, name: "John Doe" }; // Example user

            if (
              credentials.username === "admin" &&
              credentials.password === "password"
            ) {
              return user; // Return user object if credentials are valid
            } else {
              return null; // Return null if credentials are invalid
            }
          },
        }),
      ],
      pages: {
        signIn: "/auth/signin", // Custom sign-in page
      },
      callbacks: {
        async session(session, user) {
          session.user = user; // Add user object to session
          return session;
        },
      },
      secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET, // Required for JWT encryption
      session: {

      },
    });
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

11. ### What is use server in Next.js?

    The `use server` directive is used to indicate that a function should be executed on the server side. It allows you to write server-side logic in a component or function that can be called from the client side.

    ```jsx
    "use server";

    export async function myServerFunction() {
      // Server-side logic here
      return "Hello from the server!";
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

12. ### Difference between using & not using use server in Next.js?

    **Using `use server`**: The function is executed on the server side, allowing access to server-side resources and APIs. It can be used to perform operations that require server-side logic, such as database queries or API calls.

    **Not using `use server`**: The function is executed on the client side, meaning it cannot access server-side resources directly. It can only perform operations that are available in the client environment, such as manipulating the DOM or making client-side API calls.

    - **Example with `use server`**:

      ```jsx
      "use server";
      export async function fetchData() {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
      }
      ```

    - **Example without `use server`**:

      ```jsx
      export async function fetchData() {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
      }
      ```

    - Example with `use server` In Component:

      ```jsx
        import { fetchData } from "./path/to/your/file";

        export default function MyComponent() {
          const data = await fetchData(); // This will run on the server side
          return <div>{data}</div>;
        }
      ```

    - Example without `use server` In Component:

      ```jsx
      import { fetchData } from "./path/to/your/file";
      export default function MyComponent() {
        const data = fetchData(); // This will run on the client side
        return <div>{data}</div>;
      }
      ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

13. ### How do you handle API routes in Next.js?

    By creating files in the `app/api` directory, where each file corresponds to an API endpoint.

    ```jsx
    // app/api/hello/route.js
    export async function GET(request) {
      return new Response("Hello, World!");
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

14. ### How do middleware work in Next.js?

    Middleware in Next.js allows you to run code before a request is completed. You can use it to modify the request or response, redirect users, or perform authentication checks.

    ```js
    // app/middleware.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    export function middleware(request) {
      // Perform some logic here
      if (request.nextUrl.pathname === "/") {
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/home", request.url));
      }
      return NextResponse.next();
    }
    ```

    You can also specify which paths the middleware should apply to:

    ```js
    // app/middleware.js
    export const config = {
      matcher: ["/about/:path*", "/blog/:path*"],
    };
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

15. ### What is form action in Next.js?

    The `formAction` is a special attribute used in Next.js to define the action URL for a form submission. It allows you to specify a server-side function that will handle the form submission.

    ```jsx
    // app/form-example/page.js
    "use server";

    export async function handleSubmit(formData) {
      const name = formData.get("name");
      console.log("Form submitted with name:", name);
      return { success: true };
    }

    export default function FormExample() {
      return (
        <form action={handleSubmit}>
          <input type="text" name="name" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, when the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` function will be called on the server side with the form data.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

16. ### How do you handle file uploads in Next.js?

    By using the `formData` API in a server action to handle file uploads.

    ```jsx
    // app/upload/page.js
    "use server";

    export async function handleUpload(formData) {
      const file = formData.get("file");
      // Process the file (e.g., save it to a storage service)
      console.log("File uploaded:", file.name);
      return { success: true };
    }

    export default function UploadPage() {
      return (
        <form action={handleUpload} encType="multipart/form-data">
          <input type="file" name="file" />
          <button type="submit">Upload</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

17. ### Mention some common use cases for the App Router in Next.js.

    - Creating nested routes with layouts.
    - Implementing server-side rendering for dynamic content.
    - Handling API routes for backend functionality.
    - Managing authentication and authorization flows.
    - Building complex applications with shared layouts and components.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

18. ### One of the main differences between the App Router and the Pages Router in Next.js?

    The App Router allows for nested routes, layouts, and server components, while the Pages Router uses a flat file structure for routing and does not support nested routes or layouts.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

19. ### What is the use of the `use client` directive in Next.js?

    The `use client` directive is used to indicate that a component should be rendered on the client side. It allows you to write client-side logic in a component that can be executed in the browser.

    ```jsx
    "use client";

    export default function ClientComponent() {
      return <div>This component is rendered on the client side.</div>;
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

20. ### Is it possible to use both App Router and Pages Router in the same Next.js application?

    Yes, it is possible to use both App Router and Pages Router in the same Next.js application. You can have the `app` directory for the App Router and the `pages` directory for the Pages Router, allowing you to take advantage of both routing systems.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

21. ### Are there any limitations of the App Router in Next.js?

    Yes, some limitations of the App Router include:

    - It is only available in Next.js 13 and later versions.
    - It may not support all features available in the Pages Router.
    - Some third-party libraries may not be compatible with the App Router.
    - Many features from the Pages Router, such as `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`, are not available in the App Router.
    - The App Router is still evolving, and some features may change or be added in future releases.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

22. ### Explain the concept of authorization in middleware & routes in Next.js.

    Authorization in middleware and routes in Next.js involves checking if a user has the necessary permissions to access a specific route or perform an action. This can be done by verifying user roles, permissions, or tokens in the middleware function before allowing access to the route.

    ```js
    // app/middleware.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

    export function middleware(request) {
      const token = request.cookies.get("authToken");

      if (!token) {
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", request.url));
      }

      // Additional authorization logic can go here

      return NextResponse.next();
    }

    export const config = {
      matcher: ["/protected/:path*"], // Apply middleware to protected routes
    };
    ```

    In this example, the middleware checks for an authentication token in the cookies. If the token is not present, it redirects the user to the login page. If the token is valid, it allows access to the protected routes.

    ```js
    // app/api/protected/route.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    export async function GET(request) {
      const token = request.cookies.get("authToken");

      if (!token) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
      }

      // Handle the request for authorized users
      return NextResponse.json({ message: "Protected data" });
    }
    ```

    In this example, the API route checks for the authentication token in the request cookies. If the token is not present, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response. If the token is valid, it returns the protected data.

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

23. ### The difference between `use server` and `use client` in Next.js?

    - **`use server`**: Indicates that the function should be executed on the server side. It allows you to write server-side logic that can be called from the client side.

    - **`use client`**: Indicates that the component should be rendered on the client side. It allows you to write client-side logic that can be executed in the browser.

    ```jsx
    // Example of use server
    "use server";

    export async function fetchData() {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      return response.json();
    }

    // Example of use client
    ("use client");

    export default function ClientComponent() {
      return <div>This component is rendered on the client side.</div>;
    }
    ```

    [:arrow_up: Back to Top](#app-router-table-of-contents)

24. ### Understand the concept of server actions in Next.js.

    Server actions in Next.js allow you to define functions that can be executed on the server side when a form is submitted or an action is triggered. These functions can handle data processing, database interactions, or any server-side logic.

    ```jsx
    // app/actions/submitForm.js
    "use server";

    export async function submitForm(formData) {
      const name = formData.get("name");
      console.log("Form submitted with name:", name);
      return { success: true };
    }
    ```

    You can then use this action in a form:

    ```jsx
    // app/form/page.js
    import { submitForm } from "../actions/submitForm";

    export default function FormPage() {
      return (
        <form action={submitForm}>
          <input type="text" name="name" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

25. ### Whats are the benifit of using server actions in Next.js?

    - **Performance**: Server actions allow you to offload heavy computations or data processing to the server, reducing the load on the client.
    - **Security**: Sensitive operations can be performed on the server, preventing exposure of sensitive data or logic to the client.
    - **Simplified Data Fetching**: You can fetch data directly in server actions without needing to manage client-side state or effects.
    - **Reduced Client Bundle Size**: By moving logic to the server, you can reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, improving load times.

26. ### What's are the problem of using server actions in Next.js?

    - **Latency**: Server actions can introduce latency since they require a round trip to the server, which may not be ideal for real-time interactions.
    - **Complexity**: Managing server actions can add complexity to your application, especially if you have many actions or need to handle different states.
    - **Limited Client-Side Interactivity**: Since server actions are executed on the server, they may not provide the same level of interactivity as client-side functions.
    - **Debugging Challenges**: Debugging server actions can be more challenging compared to client-side code, as you may not have access to browser developer tools.

27. ### Alternative options instead of server actions in Next.js?

    - **API Routes**: You can create API routes to handle server-side logic and data fetching, which can be called from the client side.
    - **Client-Side Fetching**: Use client-side data fetching methods like `useEffect` or libraries like SWR or React Query to manage data on the client side.
    - **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Use SSG for pages that can be pre-rendered at build time, reducing the need for server actions.
    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Use SSR for dynamic pages that require server-side data fetching on each request.

28. ### Alternative solutions example of not using server actions in Next.js?

    Instead of using server actions, you can use API routes to handle form submissions or data processing. Here's an example:

    ```jsx
    // app/api/submitForm/route.js
    export async function POST(request) {
      const formData = await request.formData();
      const name = formData.get("name");
      console.log("Form submitted with name:", name);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true }), {
        status: 200,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }
    ```

    You can then call this API route from a client-side component:

    ```jsx
    // app/form/page.js
    export default function FormPage() {
      const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.target);
        const response = await fetch("/api/submitForm", {
          method: "POST",
          body: formData,
        });
        const result = await response.json();
        console.log(result);
      };

      return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <input type="text" name="name" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```

29. ### JWT Token in Next.js App Router?

    JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can be used in the Next.js App Router for authentication and authorization. You can create a JWT token upon user login and store it in a cookie or local storage. Then, you can verify the token in API routes or server-side functions to authenticate users.

    ```js
    import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

    // Create a JWT token
    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
      expiresIn: "1h",
    });

    // Verify the JWT token
    jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid token" });
      }
      // Proceed with authenticated user
    });
    ```

    Using it on application:

    ```jsx
    // app/api/auth/route.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
    export async function POST(request) {
      const { token } = await request.json();
      try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        return NextResponse.json({ userId: decoded.userId });
      } catch (error) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid token" }, { status: 401 });
      }
    }
    ```

    You can also use JWT tokens for protecting API routes:

    ```js
    // app/api/protected/route.js
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
    export async function GET(request) {
      const token = request.cookies.get("authToken");

      if (!token) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
      }

      try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        // Handle the request for authorized users
        return NextResponse.json({
          message: "Protected data",
          userId: decoded.userId,
        });
      } catch (error) {
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid token" }, { status: 401 });
      }
    }
    ```

30. ### Context of JWT Token in Next.js App Router?

    The context of using JWT tokens in the Next.js App Router is primarily for authentication and authorization purposes. JWT tokens allow you to securely transmit user information between the client and server, enabling you to verify user identity and permissions without needing to store session data on the server.

    This approach is particularly useful for stateless applications where you want to maintain user sessions without relying on server-side session storage.

31. ### Is App Router better than Pages Router in Next.js?

    The App Router offers more flexibility and features compared to the Pages Router, such as nested routes, layouts, and server components. It is designed for building complex applications with shared layouts and components.

    However, the choice between App Router and Pages Router depends on your specific use case. If you need simple routing without nested routes or layouts, the Pages Router may be sufficient.

32. ### How to handle global state management in Next.js with the App Router?

    You can handle global state management in Next.js with the App Router using libraries like Redux, Zustand, or React Context API. These libraries allow you to create a global store that can be accessed from any component in your application.

    - **Using React Context API**:

    ```jsx
    // app/context/GlobalState.js
    import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

    const GlobalStateContext = createContext();

    export function GlobalStateProvider({ children }) {
      const [state, setState] = useState({ user: null });

      return (
        <GlobalStateContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
          {children}
        </GlobalStateContext.Provider>
      );
    }

    export function useGlobalState() {
      return useContext(GlobalStateContext);
    }
    ```

    Then wrap your application with the `GlobalStateProvider`:

    ```jsx
    // app/layout.js
    import { GlobalStateProvider } from "./context/GlobalState";

    export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <GlobalStateProvider>{children}</GlobalStateProvider>
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

    Now you can access the global state in any component using the `useGlobalState` hook.

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js
    import { useGlobalState } from "./context/GlobalState";

    export default function HomePage() {
      const { state, setState } = useGlobalState();

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome, {state.user ? state.user.name : "Guest"}</h1>
          <button onClick={() => setState({ user: { name: "John Doe" } })}>
            Log In
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

33. ### fetch api of nextjs app router?

    In the Next.js App Router, you can use the `fetch` API to make HTTP requests to external APIs or your own API routes. The `fetch` function is available globally in both server and client components.

    - **Example of using fetch in a server component**:

    ```jsx
    // app/api/data/route.js
    export async function GET() {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const data = await response.json();
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
    }
    ```

    - **Example of using fetch in a client component**:

    ```jsx
    // app/page.js
    import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

    export default function HomePage() {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        async function fetchData() {
          const response = await fetch("/api/data");
          const result = await response.json();
          setData(result);
        }
        fetchData();
      }, []);

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Data from API</h1>
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
